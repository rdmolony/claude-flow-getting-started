# Getting Started with Claude Flow: A Command-Line Power User's Guide

Welcome to Claude Flow! If you're comfortable with the command line and looking to supercharge your development workflow with AI assistance, you're in the right place. This guide will get you up and running with Claude Flow in minutes.

## What is Claude Flow?

Claude Flow (also known as Claude Code) is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude's AI capabilities directly to your terminal. It's designed for developers who want to integrate AI assistance seamlessly into their existing command-line workflows.

### Key Features
- **Direct file manipulation**: Read, write, and edit files with natural language commands
- **Intelligent code search**: Find patterns and implementations across your codebase
- **Task automation**: Execute complex multi-step operations with simple prompts
- **Context awareness**: Understands your project structure and coding conventions
- **Background processes**: Run and monitor long-running tasks while continuing to work

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.8+
- A Claude API key from Anthropic

### Quick Install

```bash
# Using npm (Node.js)
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-flow

# Or using pip (Python)
pip install claude-flow

# Or using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install claude-flow
```

### Configuration

Set up your API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or configure interactively
claude-flow configure
```

## Basic Usage

### Starting a Session

```bash
# Start an interactive session in your project directory
cd your-project
claude-flow

# Or specify a directory
claude-flow --dir /path/to/project
```

### Essential Commands

Once in a Claude Flow session, you can use natural language or specific commands:

```bash
# File operations
"Show me all Python files in src/"
"Read the main.py file"
"Edit the config.json to add a new API endpoint"

# Code search
"Find all functions that handle authentication"
"Where is the database connection established?"
"Show me all TODO comments"

# Code generation
"Create a REST API endpoint for user registration"
"Write unit tests for the UserService class"
"Refactor this function to use async/await"
```

### Working with Tasks

Claude Flow excels at complex, multi-step tasks:

```bash
"Implement a caching layer for the API responses"
# Claude will:
# 1. Analyze your current architecture
# 2. Suggest an implementation approach
# 3. Create necessary files
# 4. Update existing code
# 5. Add configuration options

"Debug why the login flow is failing"
# Claude will:
# 1. Examine relevant files
# 2. Identify potential issues
# 3. Suggest and implement fixes
# 4. Verify the solution
```

## Advanced Features

### Background Processes

Run commands in the background while continuing to work:

```bash
"Run the test suite in the background"
"Start the development server and monitor logs"
"Build the project and notify me when complete"
```

### Project Context with CLAUDE.md

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root to provide context:

```markdown
# Project Context for Claude

## Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Conventions
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write tests for all new features

## Commands
- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Check code style
- `npm run build` - Build for production
```

### Slash Commands

Use slash commands for specific actions:

```bash
/help              # Show available commands
/clear             # Clear the conversation
/save session.md   # Save conversation to file
/load context.md   # Load additional context
/bashes           # Show running background processes
/tools            # List available tools
```

### IDE Integration

Claude Flow integrates with popular editors:

```bash
# VS Code
code --install-extension anthropic.claude-flow

# Vim/Neovim
:ClaudeFlow "Explain this function"

# Emacs
M-x claude-flow-query
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Refactoring Legacy Code

```bash
claude-flow
> "I need to refactor the old authentication system to use JWT tokens"

# Claude will:
# - Analyze current auth implementation
# - Create new JWT utilities
# - Update middleware and routes
# - Migrate existing sessions
# - Update tests
```

### Example 2: Adding a Feature

```bash
> "Add rate limiting to our API endpoints"

# Claude will:
# - Research your current middleware stack
# - Implement rate limiting logic
# - Add configuration options
# - Create tests
# - Update documentation
```

### Example 3: Debugging Production Issues

```bash
> "Analyze the error logs and identify what's causing the memory leak"

# Claude will:
# - Read log files
# - Identify patterns
# - Search for problematic code
# - Suggest and implement fixes
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
```bash
# Good
"Update the UserController to validate email format before saving"

# Better
"In src/controllers/UserController.js, add email validation using the existing validator library before the save() call"
```

### 2. Leverage Context
```bash
# First, provide context
"We use Jest for testing and follow the AAA pattern"

# Then make requests
"Write tests for the new payment module"
```

### 3. Use Todo Lists for Complex Tasks
```bash
"Create a todo list for migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL"
# Claude will break down the task and track progress
```

### 4. Review Changes
```bash
"Show me all the changes you've made"
"Run git diff to see what's modified"
```

## Workflow Tips

### The Review Cycle
1. Make a request
2. Let Claude implement
3. Review changes with `git diff`
4. Test the implementation
5. Request adjustments if needed

### Efficient Navigation
```bash
# Jump to specific parts of code
"Go to the error handling in app.js:45"
"Show me the implementation of calculateTotal()"
```

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Process multiple files at once
"Update all test files to use the new assertion library"
"Add proper TypeScript types to all components in src/components/"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Rate Limits**
```bash
# Check your usage
claude-flow --usage

# Use more efficient prompts
# Break large tasks into smaller chunks
```

**Context Length**
```bash
# Clear unnecessary context
/clear

# Focus on specific directories
"Only look at files in src/api/"
```

**Permission Errors**
```bash
# Ensure proper file permissions
chmod -R u+rw .

# Run with appropriate privileges
sudo claude-flow  # Only when necessary
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# In-session help
/help

# Documentation
claude-flow docs

# Report issues
claude-flow feedback
```

## Performance Optimization

### Speed Up Large Codebases
1. Use `.claudeignore` to exclude unnecessary files:
```
node_modules/
dist/
*.log
.git/
```

2. Provide focused context:
```bash
"Focus only on the backend code in src/api/"
```

3. Use specific search patterns:
```bash
"Search for 'function.*User' in **/*.js files only"
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
```bash
# Use environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Or use a secure keychain
claude-flow configure --keychain
```

### Code Review
- Always review generated code before committing
- Claude Flow never pushes to remote repositories automatically
- Sensitive data is automatically redacted from outputs

## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with Claude Flow, try these challenges:

1. **Refactor a module**: Pick a complex module and ask Claude to refactor it
2. **Add tests**: Generate comprehensive test coverage for existing code
3. **Optimize performance**: Ask Claude to identify and fix performance bottlenecks
4. **Create documentation**: Generate API documentation from your code
5. **Implement a feature**: Describe a new feature and let Claude implement it

## Conclusion

Claude Flow transforms how you interact with your codebase from the command line. It's not just about generating codeâ€”it's about having an intelligent assistant that understands your project, follows your conventions, and helps you work more efficiently.

Remember: Claude Flow is most powerful when you provide clear context, specific requirements, and review the output. Treat it as a skilled pair programmer who's always ready to help.

Happy coding with Claude Flow!
